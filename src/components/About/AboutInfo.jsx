        Hi, I'm Viktor Wahlqvist, an aspiring Front-End Developer currently
        studying at KYH. I'm actively learning how to build responsive and
        interactive web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and Sass. I’m excited to put my knowledge
        into practice during my upcoming internship (LIA) in 24 nov - 10 apr,
        where I aim to further develop my skills and contribute to real-world
        projects. On my Projects page, you can explore the various projects I've
        been working on, all hosted on my GitHub. If you’re interested in
        connecting or would like to discuss opportunities, please feel free to
        reach out via my Contact page. I'm also currently looking for a LIA
        placement to gain hands-on experience and continue my development
        journey.
